### User Services:
- **API Gateway (Port 3000)** - Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **Product Service (Port 3001)** - User management with PostgreSQL
- **Product Service (Port 3002)** - Product catalog with MongoDB
- **Order Service (Port 3003)** - Order processing with PostgreSQL

## Infrastructure Components:
- Docker containers for each service with health checks
- Docker Compose orchestration with networking
- PostgreSQL & MongoDB databases
- Redis caching layer
- Nginx load balancer
- Prometheus monitoring
- Grafana dashboards

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented:

- JWT authentication & authorization
- Input validation & error handling
- Database connection pooling
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Proper logging and security headers

## DevOps Best Practices:
